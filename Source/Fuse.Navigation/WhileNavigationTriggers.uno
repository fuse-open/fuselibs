		These triggers respond to the current "activation" state of a page.
		
		[subclass Fuse.Navigation.NavigationAnimation]
		
		The states of these triggers depends on the page progress of a page, where 0 is active and +/-1 (or higher) is inactive. These values are logically mapped into a range from 0...1 for each trigger, where 0 is the definitive "off" state of the trigger and 1 is the "on" state.
		
		Values in between are considered to be in transition. The `Threshold` and `Limit` properties can be used to adjust when these triggers flip between active/inactive on continuous navigation.
		
		If the navigation is discrete, such as with `Navigator` or `DirectNavigation` the `Threshold` will have no effect as pages are either `0` or `1` in progress. The `Limit` property should also not be used since it will also be ineffectual.

		See [Navigation Order](articles:navigation/navigationorder.md)

	/**
		Animates while the page is active.

		## Example

		The following example changes the value of a @Text element to `Active` when the
		first page of a @PageControl is active. We set the `Threshold` high to make the
		change happen later when transitioning to the page.

			<PageControl>
				<Page>
					<Panel Alignment="Center">
						<Text ux:Name="text">Inactive</Text>
						<WhileActive Threshold="0.9">
							<Change text.Value="Active" />
						</WhileActive>
					</Panel>
				</Page>
				<Page Background="Blue" />
			</PageControl>

		The progress of this trigger for a page is calculated as `1 - distance_to_active`. So a page progress of 0 will map to `1` for this trigger, and anything more than `1` away from the active page will be `0`. For example, the `Threshold="0.9"` in the above example means the trigger will become active when the page has been swiped 90% of the way to active, instead of waiting to 100%.

	/**
		Animates while the page is inactive.

		## Example

		The following example changes the value of a @Text element to `Inactive` when the
		first page of a @PageControl is inactive. We set the `Threshold` low to make the
		change happen earlier when transitioning from the page.

			<PageControl>
				<Page>

		The progress of this trigger is calculated as the page's distance from the active page (or the navigation position for continuous navigation). For example, the active page has a distance of 0, meaning this trigger will not be activated, and a page 1 away from the active has a distance of 1, meaning this trigger will be activated. The `Threshold=0.1` in this example means the trigger activates after the page has been swiped only 10% of the distance away from the active position.
