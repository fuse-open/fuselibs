	/**
		`Selectable` makes a Visual selectable. Selectable visuals are what can be selected in  a @Selection control.

		The `Value` property is used by the @Selection to track what is selected. It is a string value to make it easy to work with from JavaScript.

		## Changing the selected state

		There is no default behavior that changes a visuals selected state. In order to select a @(Selectable:selectable), you need to use @(ToggleSelection). A normal use of this would be inside a @(Clicked) trigger, like this:

			<Panel>
				<Selection />
				<Panel>
					<Selectable />
					<Clicked>
						<ToggleSelection />
					</Clicked>
				</Panel>
			</Panel>

		## Reacting to a change in selected state

		You can react to changes in the state of a @(Selectable) element using @(Selected), which pulses when the element is selected, or @(WhileSelected), which is true as long as the element is selected.
