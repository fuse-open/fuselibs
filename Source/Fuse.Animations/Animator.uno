	/** 
		Animators are used to specify which and how @Elements are to be animated when a @Trigger is triggered.
		There are three pairs of properties which are important for controlling the exact result of an animation.

		@topic Animators

		## Example

		Examples of animator types are @Change and @Move, as used in this example:
		```xml
			<Panel ux:Name="panel1" Color="Blue">
				<WhilePressed>
					<Change panel1.Color="#0f0" Duration="1" />
					<Move X="100" Delay="1" Duration="1" />
				</WhilePressed>
			</Panel>
		```
		When the @WhilePressed trigger above is activated when a pointer is pressed on the panel, 
		the animators are played according to their `Delays` and other properties.

		## Duration/DurationBack

		Animators are used to animate elements and properties in response to triggers being activated. There are many animators to choose from, all with different purposes. Common animators include @Move, @Rotate, @Scale and @Change. While these animators animate forward on activation and backward on deactivation, some animators, such as @Spin and @Cycle create a continuous looping animation while active.

		## Delay/DelayBack

		Setting the `Delay` property results in the actual animation being delayed by that amount of seconds. `DelayBack` is used to set a different delay on the backward animation. The total duration of the animation becomes the delay + the duration. The following @Change animator has a total duration of 7 seconds. It waits 5 seconds after being activated and then animates its target element over 2 seconds.

		```xml
		<Change Delay="5" Duration="2" someElement.Height="100"/>
		```

		## Easing/EasingBack

		Fuse comes with a standard set of predefined easing curves. Easing curves are used to control how an animation progresses over time. The default easing is set to `Linear`. With linear easing, the animation progresses at the same speed over its entire duration. This usually appears quite unnatural and fake. To gain a more natural feel, we can change the easing to `QuadraticInOut`, like so:

		```xml
		<Change Easing="QuadraticInOut" Duration="2" someElement.Property="SomeValue"/>
		```

		This animator will progress slowly in the beginning, faster in the middle, and then slow again in the end.

		## Track animators

		@TrackAnimator classes have a @Duration as well as a defined target
		value. Animation can be tweaked further using @Easing curves, or custom @Keyframes

		[subclass Fuse.Animations.TrackAnimator]

		## Open / looping animators

		@OpenAnimators classes have infinite duration, and typically loop or repeate forever while
		active.
