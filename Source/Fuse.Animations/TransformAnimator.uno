		Example:
		```xml

			</WhilePressed>
		```
		When pressed, this will move the element by 50 points in the X direction over 1 second, with
		a back-out easing curve.

		## Relative motion

		You may want for an element to move relative to its own size or some other elements size.
		To achieve this we can use the @RelativeTo property, for instance:
		```xml
			<Move X="0.5" RelativeTo="Size" />
		```
		The above line moves the element by 50% of its own size to the right.

			By default, when we specify `X` and `Y` offsets the @Move animator for example, the values are
			understood to be points in the local coordinate system. However, sometimes we need to
			specify a distance that are not known at design time, but is relative to the size of something else.
			This is where this property comes in handy.

			There are multiple options for this property:
			
			 * `Local` Moves the given amount of points in the X and/or Y direction.
			 * `Size` Moves the given amount times the size of the element. So X="1" moves the element by its entire width in the X direction.
			 * `ParentSize` Same as `Size` but uses the elements parents size instead.
			 * `PositionChange` Used in response to a @(LayoutAnimation) to move the element by the amount of change in position within it's parent.
			 * `WorldPositionChange` Used in response to a @(LayoutAnimation) to move the element by the amount of change in position relative to the entire display.
			 * `Keyboard` Moves the element relative to the size of the keyboard.
			 * `LayoutChange` Deprecated. Use `PositionChange` instead.

			For advanced use cases, you can also implement your own @ITranslationMode and assign to this property.

	/**
		Scales the element. Note that scale doesn't actually change the elements size. This means that the rest of the UI layout wont be affected and the animation is guaranteed to be fast.

		You can scale an element uniformly along all axes by using the `Factor` property. Alternatively, you can also scale on a per-axis basis using `Vector` or `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.

		**Tip**: You can use `Scale` relative to something using the `RelativeTo` property. The two choices are:

		* `SizeChange` - scales relative to the change in size of the element specified by the `RelativeNode` property.
		* `SizeFactor` - scales with a factor relative to another element, specified by `RelativeNode`. A factor of `1` would make it the same size as the `RelativeNode`, while a factor of `0.5` would make it half the size, and so on.
