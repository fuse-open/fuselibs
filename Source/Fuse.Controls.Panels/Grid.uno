	/** Lays out children in a grid formation.

		## RowCount and ColumnCount properties

		If what you need is a certain number of equally sized rows and/or columns,
		you can use the @RowCount and @ColumnCount properties.

			<Grid RowCount="4" ColumnCount="2"/>

		By default, elements in the grid are placed in the order they appear in UX, from left to right,
		top to bottom. However, you can explicitly specify per element which grid cell they should be placed
		in using the `Row` and `Column` properties.

			<Grid RowCount="1" ColumnCount="2">
				<Rectangle Row="0" Column="1" Color="Red"/>
				<Rectangle Row="0" Column="0" Color="Blue"/>
			</Grid>

		If you want an element to occupy multiple rows or columns,
		you can use the `RowSpan` and `ColumnSpan` properties.

			<Grid RowCount="2" ColumnCount="2">
				<Rectangle ColumnSpan="2" RowSpan="2" Color="Red"/>
			</Grid>

		## Rows and Columns properties

		More fine grained control of how the rows and column sizes are calculated can be achieved with the
		@Rows and @Columns properties. These properties accept a comma separated list of *grid sizes* which
		can take on a few different forms. The values can either be absolute, relative or automatic.

		Example of a Grid with 3 rows of size 10, 10 and 50 points, and 3 columns, the first each occupy 20%
		of the available space and the last one occupies 60%.

			<Grid Rows="10,10,50" Columns="1*,1*,3*"/>

		The proportional column sizes here are calculated by first summing all the values (1+1+3 = 5).
		Then we divide our value by the total (1/5 = 20%, 1/5 = 20%, 3/5 = 60%).

		Note that proportional sizes only make sense if the grid is expanding to fill the parent panel, or
		has a fixed size. If it is shrinking to fit it's contents the proportional rows/columns will have zero
		size.

		The following Grid has 2 rows where the first row gets the height of the tallest element in that row,
		and the second row takes up any remaining space:

			<Grid Rows="auto,1*" />
