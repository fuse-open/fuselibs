		@scriptmodule FuseJS/InterApp

		The InterApp API allows you to launch other apps, as well as respond to being launched via URI schemes.

		This module is an @EventEmitter, so the methods from @EventEmitter can be used to listen to events.

		You need to add a reference to `"Fuse.Launcher"` in your project file to use this feature.

		## Example
		```javascript
			var InterApp = require("FuseJS/InterApp");

			InterApp.on("receivedUri", function(uri) {
				console.log("Launched with URI", uri);
			});

			InterApp.launchUri("https://fuseopen.com/");
		```

		In the above example we're using the @EventEmitter `on` method to listen to the `"receivedUri"` event.

		For the [receivedUri](api:fuse/reactive/fusejs/interapp/onreceiveduri_968f99a6.json) event to be triggered, you need register a custom URI scheme for your app, as shown [here](articles:basics/uno-projects#mobile-urischeme).


		## Deep Links - Universal and App Links

		You can receive the `receivedUri` event, mentioned above, for associated web urls that have been tapped on in other apps.

		Apple: [https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links)

		Android: [https://developer.android.com/training/app-links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links)

		## Apple Universal Links

		1. Add the associated domains in your `.unoproj`
		2. Add the Apple App Site Association file to your website

		### 1. Add associated domains to your .unoproj

		```JSON
		{
			"iOS": {
				"SystemCapabilities": {
					"AssociatedDomains": ["applinks:example.com", "applinks:sub.example.com"]
				}
			}
		}
		```

		### 2. Add the Apple App Site Association file to your website

		Apple-app-site-association file format
		```JSON
		{
			"applinks": {
				"apps": [],
				"details": [
					{
						"appID": "<team identifier>.<bundle identifier>",
						"paths": [<paths>]
					}
				]
			}
		}
		```

		Basic example, this allows all urls of the domain to be validated:
		```JSON
		{
			"applinks": {
				"apps": [],
				"details": [
					{
						"appID": "1234567890.com.mypackage.myapp",
						"paths": ["*"]
					}
				]
			}
		}
		```


		Place this file either in your site’s `.well-known` directory, or directly in its root directory. If you use the `.well-known` directory, the file’s URL should match the following format:
		```
		https://<fully qualified domain>/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
		```
		Tip: make sure you can access the file and view the JSON of the apple-app-site-association file from a browser.

		Full reference: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/inter-process_communication/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/enabling_universal_links?language=objc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/inter-process_communication/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/enabling_universal_links?language=objc)

		## Android App Links

		1. Add the associated domains in your `.unoproj`
		2. Add the asset links file to your website

		### 1. Add associated domains to your .unoproj

		```JSON
		{
			"Android": {
				"AssociatedDomains": ["example.com", "sub.example.com"]
			}
		}
		```

		### 2. Add the asset links file to your website

		Example:
		```json
		[{
		  "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
		    "target": {
		      "namespace": "android_app",
		      "package_name": "com.example.puppies.app",
		      "sha256_cert_fingerprints":
		      ["14:6D:E9:83:C5:73:06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64:16:A0:83:42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF:44:E5"]
		    }
		  },
		  {
		    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
		    "target": {
		      "namespace": "android_app",
		      "package_name": "com.example.monkeys.app",
		      "sha256_cert_fingerprints":
		      ["14:6D:E9:83:C5:73:06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64:16:A0:83:42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF:44:E5"]
		    }
		}]
		```

		Each group represents an app, you will likely need one for your development version and one for your release version of your app.

		To get the `sha256_cert_fingerprints`, use the following:
		```
		keytool -list -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore
		```

		To get the sha256 for the development version of exporting with fuse, use with `android` as the password:
		`keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore`

		Place this file in your site’s `.well-known` directory. The file’s URL should match the following format:
		```
		https://domain.name/.well-known/assetlinks.json
		```
