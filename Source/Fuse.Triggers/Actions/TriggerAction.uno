		Actions are similar to @Animators, but are one-off events that fire at a particular point in time. Like animators they are activated by 
		triggers, but their effects are not reversed when their containing trigger is deactivated. Commonly examples of actions include @Set, 
		@Callback, @Hide and @Show.
