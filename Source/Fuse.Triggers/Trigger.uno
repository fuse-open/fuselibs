		will appropriately bypass, or progress normally, base on the rooting and bypass state of the trigger.
		They can also safely be called at any time (even when not rooted), but they will just be ignored in
		that case (on the expectation that OnRooted will call them again correctly).

		Triggers are the main tools for interaction response, transitions and animation in Fuse.
		
		@topic Triggers and animation

		Triggers are objects that can be used in UX markup that detect events, gestures, other user input or
		changes of state in your app, and performs animations and actions in response.

		When a trigger is *activated*, it performs a *timeline of actions* based on what objects you put inside
		the trigger tag.

		Triggers can contain the following types of child-nodes in UX Markup:

		* @Animators that animate properties, transforms or effects when the trigger is active
		* @Actions that perform actions with permanent effects, or call back to JavaScript when the trigger activates.
		* @Nodes (visuals, behaviors, other triggers) that are added to the parent visual while the trigger is active.
		* @Resources (nodes marked with `ux:Key="your_key"`), which overrides `{Resource your_key}` for the parent scope while the trigger is active.

		> See the [remarks section](#section-remarks) at the bottom of this page for more information

						</TriggerAnimation>
					</WhilePressed>
				</Panel>
