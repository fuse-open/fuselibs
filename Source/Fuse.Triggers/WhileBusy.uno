{
	/**
		A trigger that is active whenever a sibling or parent is marked as busy.

		UX nodes can mark themselves as busy, meaning that they are currently waiting on some background task and are not ready for rendering.
		This can be anything from making a HTTP request to performing an expensive computation.
		We can use WhileBusy to react to this, as it will be activated while a sibling or parent node is marked as busy.

		> *Note:* You can use the [FuseJS/BusyTask API](/docs/fuse/triggers/busytaskmodule) to mark nodes as busy via JavaScript.

		## Example

		The following example displays an @Image from a URL, and a text while it's loading.

			<Image Url="SOME_IMAGE_URL">
				<WhileBusy>
					<Text Value="Loading..." />
				</WhileBusy>
			</Image>

		When a node is marked as busy, its ancestors are also considered busy.
		This lets us react to multiple busy nodes in the same trigger.
		In the following example we have two @Images loaded via HTTP, and a "Loading..." indicator that fades to transparency after both images have downloaded.

			<Panel>
				<Panel ux:Name="loadingPanel" Opacity="0" Alignment="Top">
					<Text>Loading...</Text>
				</Panel>
				<WhileBusy>
					<Change loadingPanel.Opacity="1" Duration="0.5" />
				</WhileBusy>
				<StackPanel>
					<Image Url="SOME_IMAGE_URL" />
					<Image Url="SOME_OTHER_IMAGE_URL" />
				</StackPanel>
			</Panel>
