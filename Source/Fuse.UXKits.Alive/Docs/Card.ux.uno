		Cards are generally light. Thus, they have an implicit LightTheme by default.
		You can disable this behavior by using its base class, [ThemedCard](api:alive/themedcard) instead.
		
		```xml
		<Alive.ThemedCard>
			<Alive.DarkTheme />
		</Alive.ThemedCard>
		```

		Cards are Rectangles, which means they can have children and/or fills.
		```xml
		<Alive.Card Color="Alive.Gray200" />
		```

		[Alive.ImageFill](api:alive/imagefill) can be used to fill a card with an image.
		
		```xml
		<Alive.Card>
			<Alive.ImageFill File="Assets/image.jpg" />
		</Alive.Card>
		```

		[CardMedia](api:alive/cardmedia) can be used to only fill the top of a Card.
		Note: [CardMedia](api:alive/cardmedia) has an implicit [DarkTheme](api:alive/darktheme).

		[CardBody](api:alive/cardbody) is a @StackPanel with proper margin and spacing for text content in a Card.
		
		```xml
		<Alive.Card>
			<StackPanel>
				<Alive.CardMedia>
					<Alive.ImageFill File="Assets/image.jpg" />
				</Alive.CardMedia>
				<Alive.CardBody>
					<Alive.Title>Whee, I'm a card!</Alive.Title>
				</Alive.CardBody>
			</StackPanel>
		</Alive.Card>
		```
