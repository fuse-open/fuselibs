declare module "FuseJS/Environment" {

/**
    Monitor the application lifecycle from JS

    The lifecycle of an app is the time from when your app starts to the time it terminates.
    During this time the app will go through a number of states.

    The Lifecycle module allows you query the current state and also be alerted when the
    app changes state.

    ## The States

    - Starting
    - Background
    - Foreground
    - Interactive

    ### Starting
    Your app start event is implicit, as this is when your JavaScript is first evaluated.

    ### Background
    Your app is not the app the user is interactive with right now and so the operating system
    has put it into a 'sleep' state.

    Whilst your app is in this state is is not allowed to run code, but you don't have to worry
    about this as Fuse will ensure your JS/UX is not doing something when it shouldn't.

    ### Foreground
    Your app is front and center on the user's device but they cannot yet interact with it. The
    main reason to be in this state is that the user has opened the notification bar on iOS or
    Android.

    ### Interactive
    Your app is now in the foreground and is accepting input from the user.

    ## Changing States
    It would be hard to work with app lifecycle if your app could just jump around the states
    randomly. Instead we guarentee the following flow through the states:

    Starting
       
    Background ? Foreground ? Interactive
       
    Terminating

    ## No `terminating` event
    You may be wondering why there is no `terminating` event. The reason is that on mobile
    platforms the OS doesn't promise to call you when terminating your app. It may, but in
    certain circumstances (low memory, emergency phone call, etc) it won't.

    Because of this the guides for mobile platforms strongly advise against using the `terminating`
    event as a cue that the app is shutting down, instead you should be regularly 'checkpointing'
    your app so you can recover from any kind of shutdown.

    Given that we are not meant to use it, we have opted not to expose the event.

    This module is an @EventEmitter, so the methods from @EventEmitter can be used to listen to events.

    ## Example

        <JavaScript>
            var Lifecycle = require('FuseJS/Lifecycle');

            Lifecycle.on("enteringForeground", function() {
                console.log("on enteringForeground");
            });
            Lifecycle.on("enteringInteractive", function() {
                console.log("on enteringInteractive");
            });
            Lifecycle.on("exitedInteractive", function() {
                console.log("on exitedInteractive");
            });
            Lifecycle.on("enteringBackground", function() {
                console.log("on enteringBackground");
            });
            Lifecycle.on("stateChanged", function(newState) {
                console.log("on stateChanged " + newState);
            });
            module.exports = { lifecycleState: Lifecycle.observe("stateChanged") }
        </JavaScript>
        <StackPanel>
            <Text TextWrapping="Wrap">Open the Fuse Monitor to see the logs</Text>
            <Text>Current lifecycle state:</Text>
            <Text Value="{lifecycleState}" />
        </StackPanel>

    In the above example we're using the @EventEmitter `on` method to listen to the different events.
    We're also using the @EventEmitter `observe` method on the `"stateChanged"` event to get an @Observable containing the current state.

/**
    Provides geolocation services.

    Using geolocation services requires device authorization. Including the `Fuse.GeoLocation` package
    in your project will trigger a prompt for this authorization when the app is launched.

    Use [startListening](api:fuse/geolocation/geolocation/startlistening_bbef95e2.json)
    to get continual location updates. Use
    [location](api:fuse/geolocation/geolocation/getlocation.json)
    or [getLocation](api:fuse/geolocation/geolocation/getlocationasync_95a738ba.json) for one-time location requests.

    You need to add a reference to `"Fuse.GeoLocation"` in your project file to use this feature.

    This module is an @EventEmitter, so the methods from @EventEmitter can be used to listen to events.

    ## Example

    The following example shows how the different modes of operation can be used:

        <JavaScript>
            var Observable = require("FuseJS/Observable");
            var GeoLocation = require("FuseJS/GeoLocation");

            // Immediate
            var immediateLocation = JSON.stringify(GeoLocation.location);

            // Timeout
            var timeoutLocation = Observable("");
            var timeoutMs = 5000;
            GeoLocation.getLocation(timeoutMs).then(function(location) {
                timeoutLocation.value = JSON.stringify(location);
            }).catch(function(fail) {
                console.log("getLocation fail " + fail);
            });

            // Continuous
            var continuousLocation = GeoLocation.observe("changed").map(JSON.stringify);

            GeoLocation.on("error", function(fail) {
                console.log("GeoLocation error " + fail);
            });

            function startContinuousListener() {
                var intervalMs = 1000;
                var desiredAccuracyInMeters = 10;
                GeoLocation.startListening(intervalMs, desiredAccuracyInMeters);
            }

            function stopContinuousListener() {
                GeoLocation.stopListening();
            }

            module.exports = {
                immediateLocation: immediateLocation,
                timeoutLocation: timeoutLocation,
                continuousLocation: continuousLocation,

                startContinuousListener: startContinuousListener,
                stopContinuousListener: stopContinuousListener
            };
        </JavaScript>

        <StackPanel>
            <Text>Immediate:</Text>
            <Text Value="{immediateLocation}" />

            <Text>Timeout:</Text>
            <Text Value="{timeoutLocation}" />

            <Text>Continuous:</Text>
            <Text Value="{continuousLocation}" />

            <Button Text="Start continuous listener" Clicked="{startContinuousListener}" />
            <Button Text="Stop continuous listener" Clicked="{stopContinuousListener}" />
        </StackPanel>

    In the above example we're using the @EventEmitter `observe` method to create an @Observable from the
    `"changed"` event. We can also listen to changes by using the `on` method, as follows:

        GeoLocation.on("changed", function(location) { ... })

    Locations returned by this module are JavaScript objects of the following form:

        {
            latitude: a number measured in decimal degrees,
            longitude: a number measured in decimal degrees,
            accuracy: a number measured in meters
        }

    To handle errors from GeoLocation we can listen to the `"error"` event, as follows:

        GeoLocation.on("error", function(err) { ... })
*/
declare module "FuseJS/GeoLocation" {
    /**
        The last known location.

        The returned object is of the following form:

                latitude: a number measured in decimal degrees,
                longitude: a number measured in decimal degrees,
                accuracy: a number measured in meters,
                speed: speed measured in meters per second
            }

/**
    Utility methods for common Image manipulation.

    > To use this module, add `Fuse.ImageTools` to your package references in your `.unoproj`.

    Fuse represents images as frozen JavaScript Image objects, consisting of a path, a filename, a width and a height.
    Once created or acquired, Images can be passed around to other APIs to use, fetch or alter their underlying data.
    All images are temporary "scratch images" until storage has been specified either through publishing to the CameraRoll or other.

    On Android using this API will request the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions.

/**
    Create, schedule and react to notifications created locally

    Sometimes you need to alert your user to an event in your app even when your app is not running in the foreground. For this, most mobile devices have some concept of Notifications. This piece of documentation covers 'Local Notifications', which are notifications scheduled from the app itself. 'Push Notifications' are notifications sent from a server elsewhere and are covered [here](api:fuse/pushnotifications/push).

    As with many of our bindings over OS features we like to start with a light API and build up. We are very interested in comments & requests, so do drop by the forums and let us know.

    ## Getting Set Up

    Include the Fuse local notification library by adding the following to your `.unoproj` file

        "Packages": [
            ...
            "Fuse.LocalNotifications",
            ...
        ],

    This is enough to start using this feature in your apps. Let's look at that now.

    ## App Example

    This is a full Fuse app that uses Local Notifications:

        <App>
            <JavaScript>
                var LocalNotify = require("FuseJS/LocalNotifications");

                LocalNotify.on("receivedMessage", function(payload) {
                    console.log("Received Local Notification: " + payload);
                    LocalNotify.clearAllNotifications();
                });

                function sendLater() {
                    LocalNotify.later(4, "Finally!", "4 seconds is a long time", "hmm?", true);
                }

                function sendNow() {
                    LocalNotify.now("Boom!", "Just like that", "payload", true);
                }

                module.exports = {
                    sendNow: sendNow,
                    sendLater: sendLater
                };
            </JavaScript>
            <DockPanel>
                <TopFrameBackground DockPanel.Dock="Top" />
                <ScrollView>
                    <StackPanel>
                        <Button Clicked="{sendNow}" Text="Send notification now" Height="60"/>
                        <Button Clicked="{sendLater}" Text="Send notification in 4 seconds" Height="60"/>
                    </StackPanel>
                </ScrollView>
                <BottomBarBackground DockPanel.Dock="Bottom" />
            </DockPanel>
        </App>

    Let's break down what is happening here.

    ## How it works

    We will skip the `module.exports` and stuff inside the `DockPanel`, as that is better explained in other guides. Let's instead go through the JS.

    After `require`ing our module like normal, we set up a function which will deliver a notification 4 seconds in the future.

        function sendLater() {
            LocalNotify.later(4, "Finally!", "4 seconds is a long time", "hmm?", true);
        }

    The `later` function take the following parameters:

    - `secondsFromNow`: How long in seconds until the notification fires
    - `title`: the `string` which will be the title in the notification when it shows in the device's notification bar
    - `body`: the `string` which will be the body of the notification when it shows in the device's notification bar
    - `payload`: a string which is not shown in the notification itself, but will be present in the callback.
    - `sound`: a `bool` specifying whether or not the device should make the default notification sound when it is shown in the notification bar
    - `badgeNumber`: An optional parameter that is only used on iOS, which puts a badge number against the apps icon. This is often used for showing the quantity of 'things' that need the user's attention. For example an email app could show the number of unread emails.

        function sendNow() {
            LocalNotify.now("Boom!", "Just like that", "payload", true);
        }

    The `now` function is almost identical to the `later` function, except that it doesnt have the `secondsFromNow` parameter.

    One last thing to note about both `now` and `later`, is that they will not deliver a notification to the user if the app is open. Instead, they will trigger the `receivedMessage` event silently.

    Finally, we set up the function that will be called whenever we get a notification, by using the @EventEmitter `on` method to register it.

        LocalNotify.on("receivedMessage", function(payload) {
            console.log("Received Local Notification: " + payload);
            LocalNotify.clearAllNotifications();
            LocalNotify.clearBadgeNumber();
        });

    This function is called whenever a notification is delivered while the app is open, or when the app is started from a notification the user has selected.

    The `payload` will be a string in JSON format containing the following keys:
    - `'title'`: the notification's title as a `string`
    - `'body'`: the body text of the notification as a `string`
    - `'payload'`: the `string` of data that was sent with the notification.

    `clearAllNotifications()` clears all notifications made by the app that have already been delivered. This can be used to remove similar notifications if one is clicked.

    Last, but not least, `clearBadgeNumber()` clears the little number next to the app icon on the home screen, showing the amount of notifications the app has.

    ## Lifecyle Behavior

    How your notification is treated by the OS depends on the state of the app. If the app is `Interactive`, the notification does not appear, and is instead delivered straight to your running app. If it is not interactive, the OS will create a notification based on the parameters you gave to the `later` or `not` functions. `Interactive` not only means that your app is in the `Foreground`, but that it also is not being obscured by other windows. One example of being in the `Foreground` and not `Interactive`, is when you swipe the status-bar to open the 'Notification Center/Drawer'.

    You can try this with the example app above. Hit the `Send notification in 4 seconds` button, and open the 'Notification Center/Drawer'

    ## Remarks

    This module is an @EventEmitter, so the methods from @EventEmitter can be used to listen to events.

    You need to add a reference to `"Fuse.LocalNotifications"` in your project file to use this feature.
*/
declare module "FuseJS/LocalNotifications" {
    type Event = "receivedMessage";

    /**
        Registers a function to be called when one of the following events occur.

        * `"receivedMessage"` -
    */
    function on(event: Event, callback: () => void): void;

    /**
        Dismisses all currently active notifications created by our app.
    */
    function clearAllNotifications(): any;

    /**

    */
    function clearBadgeNumber(): any;

    /**

    */
    function later(secondsFromNow: any, title: any, body: any, payload: any, sound: any, badgeNumber: any): any;

    /**
        Instantly displays a notification to the user.
    */
    function now(title: any, body: any, payload: any, sound: any, badgeNumber: any): any;

}

/**
    Handles push notification from messaging services.

    This module currently supports APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) and GCM (Google Cloud Messaging).

    Fuse provides support for push-notifications from Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Apple' Push Notification Service (APNS).

    We have opted for a lightweight consistent interface across iOS and Android which we can easily expand as needed.

    > We are very interested in comments & requests you have on what we have so far so do drop by the forums and let us know.

    ## Setting up the client side

    ### Step 1.

    Include the Fuse push notification library by adding the following to your `.unoproj` file

        "Packages": [
            ...
            "Fuse.PushNotifications",
            ...
        ],

    ### Step 2. (Only for Android)

    Google notifications require a little extra info.

    Add the following to you `.unoproj`

        "Android": {
            ...
            "GooglePlay": {
                "SenderID": "111781901112"
            }
            ...
        },

    The `SenderID` is the sender ID from the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
    If you don't yet have a project set up please see the [Android setup](#android-setup) section later in this document.

    ## How this behaves in your app

    Referencing `Fuse.PushNotifications` will do the the following:

    ### Both Platforms

    - You get a callback telling you if the registration succeeded or failed.
    - The succeeded callback will contain your unique registration id (also called a token in iOS docs)
    - All future received push notifications will fire a callback containing the JSON of the notification.

    All three callbacks mentioned are available in JavaScript and Uno.

    ### Android specific

    - Your SenderID is added to the project's `Manifest.xml` file along with some other plumbing
    - When your app starts the app registers with the `GCM` service.

    ### iOS specific

    - When your app starts it registers with APNS. As all access is controlled through Apple's certificate system there is no extra info to provide (we will mention server side a bit later)

    If you wish to disable auto-registration you can place the following in your unoproj file:

        "iOS": {
            "PushNotifications": {
                "RegisterOnLaunch": false
            }
        },

    You must then register for push notifications by calling `register()` from JS. This option is useful as when the notifications are registered the OS may ask the user for permission to use push notifications and this may be undesirable on launch.

    ## Using the API from JavaScript

    Integrating with notifications from JavaScript is simple. Here is an example that just logs when the callbacks fire:

        <JavaScript>
            var push = require("FuseJS/Push");

            push.on("registrationSucceeded", function(regID) {
                console.log("Reg Succeeded: " + regID);
            });

            push.on("error", function(reason) {
                console.log("Reg Failed: " + reason);
            });

            push.on("receivedMessage", function(payload) {
                console.log("Recieved Push Notification: " + payload);
            });
        </JavaScript>

    Here we're using the @EventEmitter `on` method to register our functions with the different events.
    In a real app we should send our `registration ID` to our server when `registrationSucceeded` is triggered.

    ## Server Side

    When we have our client all set up and ready to go we move on to the backend. For this we are required to jump through the hoops provided by Apple and Google.

    See below for the following guides on how to do this for specific platforms:

    - [iOS Setup](#ios-setup)
    - [Android Setup](#android-setup)

    ## The Notification

    We support push notifications in JSON format. When a notification arrives one of two things will happen:

    - If our app has focus, the callback is called right away with the full JSON payload
    - If our app doesn't have focus, (and our JSON contains the correct data) we will add a system notification to the notification bar (called the Notification Center in iOS). When the user clicks the notification in the drop down then our app is launched and the notification is delivered.

    Apple and Google's APIs define how the data in the payload is used to populate the system notification, however we have normalized it a little.

    For iOS we'll just include an `aps` entry in the notification's JSON, like so:

        'aps': {
            alert: {
                'title': 'Well would ya look at that!',
                'body': 'Hello from the server'
            }
        },

    And 'title' and 'body' will be used as the title and body of the system notification.

    For Android we can use exactly the same `'aps'` entry or the alternatively the following:

        'notification': {
            alert: {
                'title': 'Well would ya look at that!',
                'body': 'Hello from the server'
            }
        },

    The `notification` entry is the standard Google way of doing this but we felt that it wouldn't hurt to support the Apple way too.

    > The current implementation only guarantees the `title` and `body` entries will work. We also always use your app's icon as the notification icon. This is an area we will extend as Fuse matures. If you have specific requests, be sure to let us know!

    ## Message size limits

    Google and Apple has different limits on the size of push notifications.

    - Google limits to 4096 bytes
    - Apple limits to 2048 bytes on iOS 8 and up but only 256 bytes on all earlier versions

    ## Remarks

    This module is an @EventEmitter, so the methods from @EventEmitter can be used to listen to events.

    You need to add a reference to `Fuse.PushNotifications` in your project file to use this feature.

    ## Android setup
    This section covers how to set up Firebase Push Notifications to the point that you can send test messages to a Fuse App from the Firebase console.

    ### Registering the Sender ID

    - Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
    - Select your project or create one if you haven't already
    - Click the little cogwheel button at the top of the sidebar, and press "Project settings"
    - Navigate to the "Cloud Messaging" tab
    - Copy the "Sender ID" into your `.unoproj` like this:

            "Android": {
                "GooglePlay": {
                    "SenderID": "<Sender ID goes here>"
                }
            }

    ### Registering the Android app

    To enable Firebase Cloud Messaging, you need to register an Android app with your Firebase project.
    If you haven't already registered an Android app, follow these steps:

    - From the settings page, click the button to add a new Android app to the project
    - A dialog will pop up, prompting you for a package name (the other fields are optional).
        By default, this will be `com.apps.<yourappnameinlowercase>`.
        However, it is recommended to set your own:

            "Android": {
                "Package": "com.mycompany.myapp",
            }

    - After adding the Android app, you will be prompted to download a `google-services.json` file.
        This can be ignored, as it's not needed for push notifications and can always be downloaded later if needed.

    ### Sending notifications

    After rebuilding your project with the new settings, you should be ready to send and receive push notifications.

    > **Note:** Fuse currently only supports `data` type messages. See [here for details on messages types](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#data_messages) & [this forum post](https://forums.fusetools.com/t/push-notificacions-with-google-firebase-notifications/2910/16) for more information on how we will fix this in future.
    > Sadly this means you currently can't use the Firebase Console to send test notifications (they will appear in the notification bar but will fail to reach JS).
    > See the example below for an example of how to send messages to a Fuse app.

    When your app starts, the `registrationSucceeded` event will be triggered and you will be given the `regID`
    This, along with your FCM Server key, are the details that is needed to send that app a notification.

    Your server key can be found under the "Cloud Messaging" tab of the Project Settings page (where you obtained your Sender ID).

    Here some example Fuse code for sending your app a notification.

        <JavaScript>
            var API_ACCESS_KEY = '----HARDCODED API KEY----';
            var regID = '----HARDCODED REG ID FROM THE APP YOU ARE SENDING TO----';

            module.exports.send = function() {
                fetch('https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/send', {
                    method: 'post',
                    headers: {
                        'Authorization': 'key=' + API_ACCESS_KEY,
                        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
                    },
                    body: JSON.stringify({
                        registration_ids: [regID],
                        data: {
                            notification: {
                                alert: {
                                    title: 'Well would ya look at that!',
                                    body: 'Hello from some other app'
                                }
                            },
                            payload: 'anything you like'
                        }
                    })
                }).then(function(response) {
                    console.log(JSON.stringify(response));
                }, function(error) {
                    console.log(error);
                });
            }
        </JavaScript>

    Whilst hardcoding the RegID is clearly not a good idea, it serves the purpose for this simple test.

    ## iOS setup
    This section covers how to set up a iOS Push Notifications to the point that you can send messages to a Fuse App.

    ### Certifying your app for ACS

    To do this you need an SSL certificate for your app.

    - Go to the [Apple Dev Center](https://developer.apple.com/account/overview.action)
    - Go to the Certificates Section for iOS apps
    - In the link bar on the left, under the `Identifiers` section click `App IDs`
    - Click the `+` icon in the top right to create a new App ID
    - Fill in the details, you cant use push notification with a `Wildcard App ID` so pick `Explicit App ID` and check in XCode for the app's `Bundle ID`
    - Under `App Services` enable Push notifications (and anything else you need)
    - Click `Continue` and confirm the certificate choice you made.

    ### Syncing XCode

    Your app is now authenticated for Push notifications. Be sure to resync your profiles in XCode before re-building your app.
    To do this:
    - Open XCode
    - In the menu-bar choose `XCode`->`Preferences`
    - In the Preferences window view the `Accounts` tab
    - In the `Accounts` tab click `View Details` for the relevant Apple ID
    - Click the small refresh button in the bottom left of the `View Details` window

    ### Sending Push Notifications to iOS from OSX

    For simple testing you may find that setting up a server is a bit of an overkill. To this end we recommend [NWPusher](https://github.com/noodlewerk/NWPusher). Download the binary [here](https://github.com/noodlewerk/NWPusher/releases/tag/0.6.3) and then follow the following sections from the README

    - `Getting started`
    - `Certificate`
    - Instead of reading the `Device Token` section simply add the example from above to your UX file
    - Finally, follow the `Push from OS X` Section

    Done, you should now be pushing notifications from OSX to iOS.

/**
    Cross-app content sharing API for mobile targets.
    Supports sharing of raw text, and files with associated [mimetype](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).

    Uses Action Sheet on iOS and ACTION_SEND Intents on Android.

    NB: on iPad, iOS design guidelines requires a point on screen as the origin for the share popover. You can do this by passing a reference to a UX element.

    You need to add a reference to "Fuse.Share" in your project file to use this feature.

    ## Example

        <JavaScript>
            var Share = require("FuseJS/Share")
            var Camera = require("FuseJS/Camera")
            module.exports = {
                shareFile : function()
                {
                    Camera.takePicture(320,240)
                    .then(function(image) {
                        Share.shareFile(image.path, "image/*", "Photo from Fuse");
                    });
                },
                shareText : function()
                {
                    Share.shareText("https://www.fusetools.com/", "The link to Fuse website");
                }
            }
        </JavaScript>

    ## iPad example

        <Panel>
            <Button Text="Share" Clicked="{shareText}"/>
            <Panel ux:Name="ShareOrigin" Alignment="Center" Width="1" Height="1" />
