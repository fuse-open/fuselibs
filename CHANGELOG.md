# Unreleased

## ScrollView
- Added minimal support to WhileVisibleInScrollView for changes in Element layout updating the status

## Fuse.Drawing.Surface
- Added support for the Surface API in native UI for iOS. Meaning that `Curve`, `VectorLayer` and charting will work inside a `NativeViewHost`.

## WrapPanel
- Added possibility to use `RowAlignment` to align the elements in the major direction of the `WrapPanel` as well as in the minor.

## Triggers
- Several triggers were modified to properly look up the tree for a target node, whereas previously they may have only checked the immediate parent. The affected triggers are `BringIntoView`, `Show`,`Hide`,`Collapse`, `Toggle`, `TransitionState`, `Callback`, `CancelInteractions`, `Stop`, `Play`, `Resume`, `Pause`, `TransitionLayout`, `BringToFront`, `SendToBack`, `EvaluateJS`, `RaiseUserEvent`, `ScrollTo`. This should only change previous behavior if the action was previously configured incorrectly and did nothing or already found the wrong node. Many of the actions have a `Target` to target a specific node, or `TargetNode` to specify where the search begins.
- Changed/fixed `Trigger` to provide the trigger itself as the target node to a `TriggerAction`, previously it'd provide the parent of the trigger. The old behaviour was due to an old tree structure. This should have been updated a long time ago. This allows actions to reference the trigger in which they are contained. If you've created a custom Uno `TriggerAction` and need the old behaviour modify your `Perform(Node target)` to use `target.Parent`. Triggers should in general scan upwards from the target node.
# 1.2

## Image
- Fixed issue where an `<Image />` could fail to display inside a `<NativeViewHost />` on iOS

## Router
- Added `findRouter` function making it easier to use a router in a page deep inside the UI
- Fixed and issue where relative paths and nested `Router` gave an error about unknown paths

## UX Expressions (Uno-level)
- Introduced support for variable arguments to UX functions - inherit from the `Fuse.Reactive.VarArgFunction` class.
- The classes `Vector2`, `Vector3` and `Vector4` in `Fuse.Reactive` are now removed and replaced with the general purpose, variable-argument version `Vector` instead. This ensures vectors of any length are treated the same way. This is backwards incompatible in the unlikely case of having used these classes explicitly from Uno code.
- Added support for name-value pair syntax: `name: value`. Can be used for JSON-like object notation and named arguments in custom functions. Any vector of name-value pairs is interpreted as an `IObject`, e.g. `{name: 'Joe', apples: 10}` is an object.

## Templates
- Added `Identity` and `IdentityKey` to `Each`. This allows created visuals to be reused when replaced with `replaceAt` or `replaceAll` in an Observable.
- Triggers may now use templates which will be instantiated and added to the parent when active (like a node child).
	<WhileActive>
		<Circle ux:Generate="Template" Color="#AFA" Width="50" Height="50" Alignment="BottomRight"/>
	</WhileActive>
- Added templates to `NodeGroup`, which can now be used in `Each.TemplateSource` and `Instance.TemplateSource`
- `Each`, using `TemplateSource`, will no longer respond to template changes after rooting. This was done to simplify the code, and to support alternate sources, and is a minor perf improvement. It's not likely to affect any code since it didn't work correctly, and there's no way in UX to modify templates after rooting.
- A memory leak was fixed by changing `Instantiator.TemplateSource` to a WeakReference. Only if you assigned this property a temporary value in Uno would this change impact your code.
- Clarified/fixed some issues with how `Each`/`Instances` handled default templates. Previously if no matching template was found all the specified templates, or a subset, might have erronously been used. Now, as was always intended, if you use `MatchKey` and wish to have a default template you must specifiy `ux:DefaultTemplate="true"` on the default template. You cannot have multiple fallback templates, just as you can have only one template of a particular name.
- If a `ux:DefaultTemplate="true"` is specified it will be the template that is used; the complete list of templates will not be used.

## Fuse.Share
- Fixed issue where using Fuse.Share would crash on iPad. Users must provide a position for spawn origin for the share popover. Check the Fuse.Share docs for more details.
- Made iOS implementation internal, this was never ment to be public in the first place

## Optimizations
- Optimized hit testing calculations. Improves scrolling in large scroll views with deep trees inside, among other things.
- Optimized redundant OpenGL rendertarget operations. Gives speedups on some platforms.
- Optimized invalidation strategy for transforms, to avoid subtree traversion. This improves performance generally when animating large subtrees (e.g. scrollviews).
- Backwards incompatible optimization change: The `protected virtual void Visual.OnInvalidateWorldTransform()` method was removed. The contract of this method was very expensive to implement as it had to be called on all nodes, just in case it was overridden somewhere. If you have custom Uno code relying on this method (unlikely), then please rewrite to explicitly subscribe to the `Visual.WorldTransformInvalidated` event instead, like so: Override `OnRooted` and do `WorldTransformInvalidated += OnInvalidateWorldTransform;`, Override `OnUnrooted` and to `WorldTransformInvalidated -= OnInvalidateWorldTransform;`, then rewrite `protected override void OnInvalidateWorldTransform()` to `void OnInvalidateWorldTransform(object sender, EventArgs args)`
- To improve rendering speed, Fuse no longer checks for OpenGL errors in release builds in some performance-critical code paths  
- Improved perceived ScrollView performance by preventing caching while pointers are pressed on them, avoiding inconsistent framerates.
- Fixed a bug which prevented elements like `Image` to use fast-track rendering in trivial cases with opacity (avoids render to texture).

## Multitouch
- Fixed issue where during multitouch all input would stop if one finger was lifted.
- Added the option to opt-out of automatic handling of touch events when implementing a native view.

## Attract
- Added the `attract` feature, which was previously only in premiumlibs. This provides a much simpler syntax for animation than the `Attractor` behavior.

## Gesture
- The experimental `IGesture` interface has changed. 
  * The `Significance`, `Priority` and `PriotityAdjustment` have been merged into the single `GetPriority` function.
  * `OnCapture` is changed to `OnCaptureChanged` and provides the previous capture state 
- `Clicked`, `DoubleClicked`, `Tapped`, `DoubleTapped`, and `LongPressed` have been corrected to only detect the primary "first" pointer press. If you'd like to accept any pointer index add `PointerIndex="Any"` to the gesture.
    <Clicked PointerIndex="Any"/>
- `SwipeGesture`, `ScrollView`, `LinearRangeBehaviour` (`Slider`), `CircularRangeBehaviour`, `Clicked`, `Tapped`, `DoubleClicked`, `DoubleTapped`, `LongPressed`, `WhilePressed` all use the gesture system now. They have a `GesturePriority` property which can be used to adjust relative priorities -- though mostly the defaults should be fine.
- The `SwipeGesture.GesturePriority` default is changed from `High` to `Low`. This better fits with how the priorities should work together in a typical app and in general shouldn't affect any usual layouts. You can alter the priority with `GesturePriority="High"`

## Each Reuse
- Added `Reuse` to `Each` allowing the reuse of nodes
- Added `OnChildMoved` to `Visual`. Anything implementing `OnChildAdded` or `OnChildRemoved` will likely need to implement `OnChildMoved` as well. This happens when a child's position in `Children` list changes.
- Added `OnChildMovedWhileRooted` to `IParentObserver`

## UX Expression improvements
- Added `parameter(page)` function which returns the routing parameter of the page parsed as an JSON string.
- UX expressions now support arbitrary array lookups, e.g. `{someArray[index+3]}`. The same syntax can also be used with string keys, e.g `{someObject[someKey]}`. The lookup is fully reactive - both the collection and the key/index can change.

## JavaScript Dependency Injection
- Added support for injecting UX expressions into `<JavaScript>` tags using the `dep` XML namespace. See docs on `JavaScript.Dependencies` for details.

##Â WhileVisibleInScrollView
- Added `How` property to `WhileVisibleInScrollView` trigger that accepts values `Partial` (default) and `Full`. When set to `Full`, the trigger is only active when the whole element bounds are inside view.


# 1.1

### Navigation
- Fixed an issue where `Activated` and `WhileActivated` within an `EdgeNavigator` did not correctly identify an active state
- Changed `EdgeNavigation` to return a page in `Active` when no side-panels are active

### Fuse.Share
- Fixed a crash in the iOS implementation for Fuse.Share that could happen on iPad.

### FuseJS
- Fixed a bug where disposing a JavaScript tag that has called the findData-method could lead to a crash.


## 1.1.0

### WhileActive
- Fixed a crash in the rooting of certain tree structures using any of the Navigation triggers such as `WhileActive`

### Fuse.ImageTools
- Fixed bug preventing handling of `KEEP_ASPECT` resize mode on Android when using ImageTools.resize 

### Fuse.Camera
- iOS: Fixed crash when using Fuse.Camera alongside `<iOS.StatusBarConfig IsVisible="false" />`

### Fuse.Launchers
- Fixed bug on iOS where URIs were incorrectly encoded, leading to some input with reserved URI-characters misbehaving.

### ImageTools
- Fixed bug in Android implementation that could result in errors due to prematurely recycled bitmaps

### FuseJS/Bundle
- Added `.list()` to fetch a list of all bundled files
- Added `.readBuffer()` to read a bundle as an ArrayBuffer
- Added `.extract()` to write a bundled file into a destination path

### Image
- A failed to load Image with a Url will now try again when the Url is used again in a new Image
- Added `reload` and `retry` JavaScript functions on `Image` to allow reloading failed images.
- Fixed infinite recursion bug that could happen if a MemoryPolicy is set on a MultiDensityImageSource

### ScrollingAnimation
- Fixed issue where the animation could become out of sync if the properties on ScrollingAnimation were updated.

### macOS SIGILL problems
- Updated the bundled Freetype library on macOS to now (again) include both 32-bit and 64-bit symbols, which fixes an issue where .NET and preview builds would crash with a SIGILL at startup when running on older Mac models.
- Updated the bundled libjpeg, libpng, Freetype, and SDL2 libaries for macOS to not use AVX instructions, since they are incompatible with the CPUs in some older Mac models. This fixes an issue with SIGILLs in native builds.

### Native
- Added feature toggle for implicit `GraphicsView`. If you are making an app using only Native UI disabling the implicit `GraphicsView` can increase performance. Disable the `GraphicsView` by defining `DISABLE_IMPLICIT_GRAPHICSVIEW` when building. For example `uno build -t=ios -DDISABLE_IMPLICIT_GRAPHICSVIEW`

### Gestures
- Fuse.Input.Gesture now only has an internal constructor. This means that external code can't instantiate it. But before, they already couldn't do so in a *meaningful* way, so this shouldn't really affect any applications.

### Native TextInput
- Fixed issue where focusing a `<TextInput />` or `<TextView />` by tapping it would not update the caret position accordingly. 

### Route Navigation Triggers
- `Activated`, `Deactivated`, `WhileActive`, `WhileInactve` have all been fixed when used inside nested navigation. Previously they would only consider the local navigation, not the entire tree. If the old behavior is still desired you can set the `Path="Local"` option on the navigation.
- `Activated`, `Deactivated` have been fixed to only trigger when the navigation is again stable. If you'd instead like to trigger the moment the active page changes, which is closest to the previous undefined behavior, set `When="Immediate"`
- The `NavigationPageProxy` use pattern has changed. `Rooted` is removed, `Unrooted` is now `Dispose`, and the constructor takes the parent argument. This encourages a safer use (avoiding leaks).

### MapView
- Support MapMarker icon anchor X/Y/File properties when setting MapMarkers via JS
- Added `<MapMarker Tapped="{myHandler}"/>` to retain the data context for each tapped marker.
- Added `<MapView AllowScroll="false"/>` to disable the user panning and scrolling around.
- Fixed a bug causing crashes on iPhone 5s devices when using `ShowMyLocation="true"`

### WebView
- Added `<WebView ScrollEnabled="false"/>` to disable the user panning and scrolling around.

### Fuse.Box / Fuse.Ray
- Uno.Geometry.Box and Uno.Geometry.Ray has been replaced with Fuse.Box and Fuse.Ray.

### MemoryPolicy
- Added `QuickUnload` memory policy to keep data in memory for as short as possible.

### ImageTools
- Added supported for encoding/decoding images to/from base64 on DotNet platforms, including Windows and Mac OS X.

### Bugfixes
- Fixes a bug where the app would crash if a databinding resolved to an incompatible type (e.g. binding a number property to a boolean value). (Marshal.TryConvertTo would throw exception instead of fail gracefully).

### Fuse.Controls.Video
- Fixed a bug where HLS streams would become zero-sized on iOS.

### Expression functions
- added `index` and `offsetIndex` as funtions to get the position of an element inside an `Each`
- added functions `mod`, `even`, `odd`, and `alternate` to complement the index functions. These allow visually grouping elements on the screen based on their index.
- added trigonometric math functions `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `atan2`, `radiansToDegrees`, `degreesToRadians`
- added math functions `abs`, `sqrt`, `ceil`, `floor`, `exp`, `exp2`, `fract`,`log`, `log2`, `sign`, `pow`, `round`, `trunc`, `clamp`
- added `lerp` function for linear interpolation between values


# 1.0

### FuseJS
- Fixed a bug where disposing a JavaScript tag that has called the findData-method could lead to a crash.

## 1.0.4

### GraphicsView
- Fixed issue where apps would not redraw when returning to Foreground

### ScrollView
- Fixed possible nullref in Scroller that could happen in certain cases while scrolling a ScrollView
- Fixed nullref in Scroll that could happen if there are any pending LostCapture callbacks after the Scroller is Unrooted

### Fuse.Elements
- Fixed an issue where the rendering of one element could bleed into the rendering of another element under some very specific circumstances.


## 1.0.3

### ColumnLayout
- Fixed an issue that would result in a broken layout if a `Sizing="Fill"` was used there wasn't enough space for one column.

### Bug in Container
- Fixed bug in Container which caused crash when the container had no subtree nodes. This caused the Fuse.MaterialDesign community package to stop working.

### Fuse.Controls.Video
- Fixed a bug where we would trigger errors on Android if a live-stream was seeked or paused.

### Experimental.TextureLoader
- Fixed an issue when loading images bigger than the maximum texture-size. Instead of failing, the image gets down-scaled so it fits.


## 1.0.2

This release only upgraded Uno.


## 1.0.1

### Fuse.Elements
- Fixed a bug where elements with many children and some of them were rotated, the rotated elements would appear in the wrong location.


## 1.0.0

### iOS
- Fix bug which could cause visual glitches the first time rotating from Portrait to Landscape

### Fuse.Reactive
- The interfaces `IObservable`, `ISubscriber` and `IObserver` are no longer public (affects any class that implements them). These were made accidentally public in Fuse 0.36. These need to be internal in order to allow behind-the scenes optimizations going forward.

### Bugfixes
- Fixes a bug (regression in 0.36) where functions could not be used as data context in event callbacks.
- Fixed a bug where strings like `"20%"` did not marshal correctly to `Size` when databound.
- Fixed a defect in expression functions `x,y,width,height`, they will not use the correct size if referring to an element that already has a layout

### Instance/Each/Deferred
- Changes to the items will not be collected and new items added once per frame. This avoids certain processing bottlenecks. This should not cause any backwards incompatibilties, though the option `Defer="Immediate"` is available to get the previous behavior.
- `Defer="Deferred"` on `Instance`/`Each` allows the deferred creation of nodes without the need for a `Deferred` node
- `Deferred` now has an implied priority based on the node depth. Items with equal `Priority` will now be ordered based on tree depth: deeper nodes come first.

### Page busy
- A `Page` will now be busy for the first frame (or two) after it is prepared. This will block the `Navigator` from starting the transition during those frames, which should improve first frame jerkyness. The `PrepareBusy` property can be set to `None` to disable this behaviour.

### Text edit controls
- Fixed the behaviour of placeholder text in the text renderer used when targeting desktop. The placeholder text is now always visible when there is no text in the text control, even when it has focus.

### GeoLocation
- The GeoLocation module no longer throws an exception if there are no listeners to the `"error"` event when there is an error.
- Fixed an omission that meant that the old way of listening to GeoLocation events (using `GeoLocation.onChanged = ...` instead of the recommended `EventEmitter` `GeoLocation.on("changed", ...)`) did not work.

### Stroke
- The `Stroke` will no longer emit property changed events for its Brush unless it is pinned. This is not anticipated to be an issue for any projects.

### Fuse.Version
- A new static Uno class has been introduced, called `Fuse.Version`. It contains fields for the major, minor and patch-version, as well as a string with the full version number.

### Native
- Add implementation for `android.view.TextureView` to better support multiple `<GraphicsView />`'s and `<NativeViewHost />`'s on Android. 

### Container
- In order to fix a memory leak in `Container` the pre-rooting structure was changed. Children of the container will not be children of the `Subtree` until rooted. It is not believed this will have any noticable effect; other features, like Trigger, also work this way.

### Gestures
- Extended the ability of gestures at multiple levels in the UI tree to cooperate, or take priority
- SwipeGesture now has priority over ScrollView, even if in an ancestor node
- Edge swipes have priority over directional swipes, regardless of the node they are in
- Removed `SwipeType.Continuous` as it did not work correctly and wouldn't fulfill the known use-case even if it did. Consider using `Auto` instead.
- Deprecated public access to the `Scroller` class. This is an internal class and should not be used. All functionality is accessible via `ScrollView`
- Added `SwipeGesture.GesturePriority` and `ScrollView.GesturePriority` to adjust priorities
- Fixed an issue where a higher level capture where preempt one lower in the UI tree

### Visual
- The `then` argument to `BeginRemoveChild` is now an `Action<Node>` to provide the node to the callback. Add an `Node child` argument to the callback function.

### ImageTools
- Changed the algorithm for creating new file names for temporary images. Previously this used a date format that caused problems when several images were created in sub-second intervals, breaking custom map marker icons, for instance.
- Fixed a memory leak that occured when resizing multiple images one after another.

### Vector drawing
A new vector drawing system has been added to Fuse. This allows drawing of curves, shapes, and simple vector images.
- Added `Curve` which allows drawing of lines and polygons. `CurvePoint` can be used to bind to JavaScript observables and servers as the basis for drawing line graphs
- Reintroduced `Path`, `Ellipse`, `Star` and `RegularPolygon`. These are all backed by the new vector system.
- Added several options to `Ellipse` to allow drawing wedges, like with `Circle`
- Added `Arc` for drawing the outside edge of an `Ellipse`
- Added elliptic arc support to `Path` to support more SVG path data
- Removed `FitMode.StrokeMaximum` and `FitMode.ShrinkToStroke` as they could not be reliably supported or behave in a reasonable fashion. To fit accounting for stroke use a wrapping panel with padding instead.
- Removed `Path.ScaleMode` as stroke scaling is not supported as it was before
- Remove the `Fuse.Drawing.Polygons` and `Fuse.Drawing.Paths` packages. Their functionality has been replaced by the new vector system
- `Fuse.Controls.FillRule` has moved to `Fuse.Drawing.FillRule`

### Default Fonts
- Added the following default-fonts, that can be used like so `<Text Font="Bold" FontSize="30">This is some bold text</Text>`:
  * `Thin`
  * `Light`
  * `Regular`
  * `Medium`
  * `Bold`
  * `ThinItalic`
  * `LightItalic`
  * `Italic`
  * `MediumItalic`
  * `BoldItalic`

### Fuse.Audio
- Due to a bug in Mono we have temporarily removed support for PlaySound in preview on OSX.

### MapView
- Fixed a bug causing crashes on iPhone 5s devices when using `ShowMyLocation="true"`

### ImageFill
- Fixed a bug where the `MemoryPolicy` given would not be correctly used.
